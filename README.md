### Scripts

- [abbababba.py](abbababba.py) This script effectively run the ABBA BABBA analysis. It takes the comparisons provided in the file [sets2.txt] and outputs the file [allBBAA2.txt](allBBAA2.txt) that contains all the D-statistics provided by [Dsuite](https://github.com/millanek/Dsuite).
- [MainAnalysis.md](MainAnalysis.md) This R script takes the output of Dsuite to calculate all correlations and plots the main figures. It also combines the Dp statistic and all data with geographical overlap. 

### Data files:

- [BBAAwithDp.txt](BBAAwithDp.txt): Combined output of Dsuite with computed Dp statistics. The output of  [MainAnalysis.md](MainAnalysis.md).
- [allBBAA.j.txt](allBBAA.j.txt): Combined output of Dsuite with geographic overlap data. The output of  [MainAnalysis.md](MainAnalysis.md).
- [allBBAA2.txt](allBBAA2.txt): Output of [abbababba.py](abbababba.py) and main input for [MainAnalysis.md](MainAnalysis.md)
- [popmap.txt](popmap.txt): File matching samples and populations.
- [sets2.txt](sets2.txt): List of all comparsions. Three comparisons were excluded (see paper).
