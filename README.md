### Scripts

- [abbababba.py](abbababba.py) This script effectively run the ABBA BABBA analysis. It takes the comparisons provided in the file [sets2.txt] and output the file [allBBAA2.txt](allBBAA2.txt) that contains all the D-statistics provided by [Dsuite](https://github.com/millanek/Dsuite).
- [plots.R](plots.R) This file takes the output of Dsuite to calculate all correlations and plots the main figures. Importantly, it also combines the Dp statistic and combine all data with the geographical overlap. 

### Data files:

- [BBAAwithDp.txt](BBAAwithDp.txt): Combined output of Dsuite with computed Dp statistics. Output of  [plots.R](plots.R).
- [allBBAA.j.txt](allBBAA.j.txt): Combined output of Dsuite with geographic overlap data. Output of  [plots.R](plots.R).
- [allBBAA2.txt](allBBAA2.txt): Output of [abbababba.py](abbababba.py) and main input for [plots.R](plots.R)
- [popmap.txt](popmap.txt): File matching samples and populations.
- [sets2.txt](sets2.txt): List of all comparsions. 3 comparisons were excluded (see paper)
